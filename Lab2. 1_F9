#AIM:
    To implement a program that uses for loop
to print the numbers 8,11,14,17,...83,86,89.

'''theory
for loop syntax is-
for variablename in range([start], stop, [stepcount]): 
                                             Statement(s) 

Here in is membership operator
'''
SOURCE CODE:

for i in range(8, 90,3):       #starting value is 8,ending value is 90 and step count is 3
                   print(i,end=",") 

#OUTPUT:

8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38,41,44,47,
50,53,56,59,62,65,68,71,74,77,80,83,86,89,
