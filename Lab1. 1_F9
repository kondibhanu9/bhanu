AIM:
     To write a program that asks the user to enter 
three numbers (use three seperate input
statements) creating variables called total 
and average that holds the sum and average of
the three numbers and print out the values 
of total and average. 

SOURCE CODE:

a=input("enter a value") 
a=int(a) 
b=input("enter b value") 
b=int(b) 
c=input("enter c value") 
c=int(c) 
total=a+b+c  #sum of a, b, c
print('total of three numbers is:',total) 
average=(total)/3 #average of a,b, c
print('the average of three numbers is:',average)

'''OUTPUT:

enter a value3
enter b value4
enter c value5
total of three numbers is: 12
the average of three numbers is: 4.0 '''
